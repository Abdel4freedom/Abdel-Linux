// * "If else" exercise

// * Less Than or Equal to Zero? *

// * 1. Create three number variables: one positive, one negative, and one which equals zero.
// Now, create three if-else statements, one for each variable, which check if the variable is less than or equal to zero.
// If the variable is less than or equal to zero, the if-else statement should print ("[variable] is less than or equal to zero!").
// If the variable is greater than zero, the if-else statement should print ("[variable] is greater than zero!").

// * 2. Next, create an ES5 function that takes in one number argument to do this for you.
// Make sure it works by calling it with five different numbers.
// This should remind you why making functions can save you a lot of time if you want to use the same code block repeatedly without having to write it again every time!

// Examples:

// isLEQZero(3) ➞ "3 is greater than zero!"
// isLEQZero(0) ➞ "0 is less than or equal to zero!"
// isLEQZero(-4) ➞ "-4 is less than or equal to zero!"
// isLEQZero(10) ➞ "10 is greater than zero!"



// * 3. Finally, create an ES6 function which does the same thing again.
// Make sure it is still working as expected by calling it with five diffent numbers.

// * 4. Bonus: Create one more ES6 function which does the same thing but takes up only one line of code!
// To do this, you should use a TERNARY OPERATOR (?:) to check whether your argument is less than or equal to zero...
// Again, you should make sure this is working as expected by calling five different numbers.
